The purpose of this plugin is to add a python plugin framework to everquest. It is a work in progress.

The project files are visual studio 2010. To build this project, open up your MacroQuest 2 solution (I have a Git Repo for that as well) in visual studio 2010, and add this project to your solution.

It is currently configured to link against boost::python 1.51 -- you will need to build them yourself. Layout should be as indicated below, or feel free to edit your project file
Get the source from: http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_51_0.html

I am also staticly linking against python 2.7.3 -- you will need to build them yourself. Layout should be as indicated below, or feel free to edit your project file
Get the source from: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

To use it properly, you'll need to copy the Scripts directory to your MacroQuest2 output directory.

Beyond this, there is no official documentation. There are several classes exposed. Look at the example scripts for some ideas.



Expected build directory layout from the current project configuration:
+ <somewhere> + MQ2 - MQ2Main
              |     - ...
              |     - MQ2Py
			  |     - ...
			  - boost_1_51_0
			  - Python-2.7.3
